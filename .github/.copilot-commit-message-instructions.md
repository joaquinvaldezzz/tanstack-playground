This markdown file outlines the guidelines, types, and formatting rules for Conventional Commit messages, with examples and explanations for best practices.

## General Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

- Use the imperative, present tense in the description ("change" not "changed").

## Commit Types

| Type     | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | Adds, adjusts, or removes a new feature to the API or UI |
| fix      | Fixes an API/UI bug caused by a previous feat commit     |
| refactor | Refactors code without altering API/UI behavior          |
| perf     | Improves performance (special kind of refactor)          |
| style    | Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons)     |
| test     | Adds missing tests or fixes tests                        |
| docs     | Documentation-only changes                               |
| build    | Build tools, dependencies, CI/CD                         |
| ops      | Infrastructure: deployment, backup, recovery, etc.       |
| chore    | Miscellaneous tasks, like updating .gitignore            |

- Use **scope** as an optional context: e.g. `feat(api):`, `fix(shopping-cart):`.
- Do **not** use issue identifiers as scopes.

## Breaking Changes

- Indicate a breaking change by adding a `!` before the colon:
  ```
  feat(api)!: remove status endpoint
  ```
- Describe breaking changes in the commit footer if the description is not enough:
  ```
  BREAKING CHANGE: ticket endpoints no longer support listing all entities.
  ```
- Best practice: Always use the `!` and add a footer when possible for visibility.

## Description

- Concise statement of the change.
- Always required.
- Use the imperative, present tense.
- Do **not** capitalize the first word or end with a period.

## Body

- Optional, details motivation and compares behavior versus before.
- Use imperative, present tense.

## Footer

- Optional unless breaking changes.
- Issue references (`Closes #123`, `Fixes JIRA-456`) or `BREAKING CHANGE:` notes.

## Versioning Guide

- **Major** bump for breaking changes.
- **Minor** bump for `feat` or `fix` if API is affected.
- **Patch** otherwise.

## Examples

```markdown
feat: add email notifications on new direct messages

fix(shopping-cart): prevent order of empty shopping cart

refactor: implement fibonacci calculation as recursion

build: update dependencies

docs: update README

feat!: remove ticket endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: ticket endpoints no longer support listing all entities.
```

## Best Practices

- Prefer specific types over `chore`, which should be a last resort.
- Never mix multiple logical commit types in a single commit.
- For merges, use the default Git merge message (`Merge branch 'branch-name'`).
- For syncing with upstream, merge commit if possible; otherwise, choose the type that reflects the changes merged (avoid using `chore` unless truly appropriate).
- Limit commit summaries to 50 characters.
